# python2 final project - Web application Heart Disease Prediction
The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease." Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease. 

According to the study from the American Heart Association, 121.5 million Americans, or about 48.5 percent, dealt with heart or blood vessel disease as of 2016. The study says deaths from cardiovascular disease rose from more than 836,000 in 2015 to more than 840,000 in 2016. 

However, many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices. Our heart disease detection tool can be used to detect your probability of having a heart disease. This tool can warn people to get a thorough body check at hospital if he/she found the probability is high. We built the tool based on machine learning algorithms with 92% accurcay.
